Please answer the below Data Structure Questions:

why do we need data structure?
A. Data structures help organize data logically, making it easier to access, search, and modify information efficiently.


What are the various operations that can be performed on different Data Structures?
Arrays, Linked Lists, Stacks, Queues, Trees, Graphs, Hash tables, Size

List out the areas in which data structures are applied extensively?
    Algorithms, Databases, Operating Systems

what is an Array?
    An array is a fundamental data structure in computer programming used to store a collection of elements, typically of the same data type, under a single variable name

what is the difference between the Array and ArrayList?
    If you need a fixed-size collection of elements, use an array. If you require flexibility and dynamic resizing, an ArrayList is a more suitable choice.

what is LinkedList?
    A LinkedList is a linear data structure in computer programming that consists of a sequence of elements, where each element contains both data and a reference o the next element in the sequence.

How is an Array different from Linked List?
    Arrays are efficient for random access and offer a simpler data structure. Linked Lists are flexible and efficient for insertions and deletions but less efficient for random access.

what is queue?
    a Queue is a linear data structure that follows the First-In-First-Out (FIFO) principle, which means that the first element added to the queue will be the first one to be removed.

what is stack?
    a Stack is a linear data structure that follows the Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) principle, which means that the last element added to the stack will be the first one to be removed.

what is FIFO and LIFO?
    FIFO (First-In-First-Out) is a principle that dictates that the first element added to a data structure or queue is the first one to be removed
    LIFO (Last-In-First-Out) is a principle that dictates that the last element added to a data structure or stack is the first one to be removed.

what is the order of complexity?
    It is a measure of how the runtime or resource usage of an algorithm grows as the size of the input data.
    It provides an estimate of how the algorithm's performance scales with larger inputs.

what is the best case to search an element from an array?
    The best case to search occurs when the element being searched for is found at the beginning of the array

what is the worst case to search an element from an array?
    The worst case for linear search occurs when the element being searched for is either not present in the array or is located at the very end of the array

what is tree in data structure?
    A tree is a hierarchical and nonlinear data structure that resembles a tree-like structure
    Trees are widely used in various applications and are essential for tasks such as organizing data, searching, and representing hierarchical relationships.

what is graph in data structure?
    A graph is a non-linear and versatile data structure used to represent a collection of interconnected objects
    Graphs are used to model relationships between entities

what is the difference between the HashTable and HashMap?
    choose HashTable when you need automatic thread safety and strict non-null key and value requirements. For most other cases HashMap is a more flexible choice.

What are the major data structures used in the following areas : RDBMS, Network data model and Hierarchical data model.
    In an RDBMS, the primary data structure is the table
    In the network data model, data is represented using nodes
    In the hierarchical data model, data is organized into a tree-like structure

How HashMap works in java?
    HashMap is data structure in Java for storing and managing key-value pairs.

What is ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException in java? When it occurs?
    It is an exception in Java that is thrown when you attempt to access an element of an array at an invalid index.

What are the different ways of copying an array into another array?
    Loop
    Using ArrayList
    Using System.arraycopy()
    Using Arrays.copyOf
    Using Arrays.copyOfRange

What is difference between an array and a linked list?
    Arrays are efficient for random access and have lower memory overhead, while linked lists are better suited for dynamic resizing and efficient insertions and deletions.

What is DFS and BFS?
    DFS is an algorithm that explores as far as possible along one branch of a tree before backtracking to explore other branches
    BFS is an algorithm that explores all the neighbor nodes at the current depth before moving on to nodes at the next depth level.

What is Recursion?
    It is a programming and problem-solving technique in which a function calls itself to solve a problem of smaller size or a related subproblem

What are linear and non linear data Structures?
    Linear data structures are data structures in which data elements are arranged in a sequential order, and each element has a unique predecessor and successor except for the first and last elements.
    Non-linear data structures are data structures in which data elements are not arranged in a sequential order with a clear predecessor-successor relationship.

What is Big-(O)-annotation?
     Big O notation is used to describe the time or space complexity of algorithms

Outlined different kind of sorting algorithm with time complexity?
    Bubble Sort
    Selection Sort
    Insertion Sort
    Heap Sort

Draw a table with time complexity in which it will summarize all the data structure feature's advantages and disadvantages.
  a)In terms of Accessing element.
  b)In terms of Inserting element.
  c)In terms of Searching element.
  d)In terms of Removing element.
